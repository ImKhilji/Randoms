## Hidden Markov Models

HMMs are a clever bit of implementation of certain basic concepts of probability and statistics and can be very simple to understand! At the same time, the scope of usage is immense - speech recognition and tagging, sentiment analysis, digit recognition etc.

Here I have implemented a simple model which learns the transition and emmission matrices using the Viterbi, following the age-old classic [Rabiner's Tutorial](http://www.ece.ucsb.edu/Faculty/Rabiner/ece259/Reprints/tutorial%20on%20hmm%20and%20applications.pdf). Do check this one out!

Needless to say, suggestions and improvements are welcome!
