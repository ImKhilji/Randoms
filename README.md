# Randoms

My life is all about tinkering and exploring the unseen, unheard, and usually the challenging topics that seem to interest me. Had been doing that since long, might as well document them in for future reference.

Currently, the repository contains the following:
* Neural Networks as Classifiers
* Random Forests for Multiclass Classification
* SLIC (Simple Linear Iterative Clustering)
* Hidden Markov Models for learning & prediction
* ARIMA for time series forecasting (_Incomplete_)

Feel free to use portions or raise an issue if I messed up. I will try my best to keep adding new stuff I explore.
Cheers.

### Inviting Contributors
If you used the repo and it did help you, feel free to make PRs with your own versions of the code and/or an associated `readme`. I was too lazy to write one when I made these! :p
