# Randoms

My life is all about tinkering and exploring the unseen, unheard, and usually the challenging topics that seem to interest me. Had been doing that since long, might as well document them in for future reference.

Currently, the repository contains the following:
* Neural Networks as Classifiers
* Random Forests for Multiclass Classification
* SLIC (Simple Linear Iterative Clustering)

Feel free to use portions or raise an issue if I messed up. I will try my best to keep adding new stuff I explore.
Cheers.
